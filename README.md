procwatcher
===========

Very much in beta but you might find it of use.

It requires libqt4-dev to be installed. If it is you can, in the procwatcher directory, type:

qmake

make

and then run the application:

./procwatcher

The help files aren't written yet but there's not a lot to it. 

man proc

has a lot of info about what you are seeing.
